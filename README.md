# Tic Tac Toe

This is a standard Tic Tac Toe game except the players have awesome Lego Star Wars icons to place on the board instead of your 
typical Xs and Os. I made this by following a Udemy course/tutorial as an introduction to using C++ as well as features built 
into Visual Studio Window apps. It was interesting seeing unicode worked into the application.
